Selected a data set from the https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php names PAGE BLOCK CLASSIFICATION with 5400 plus data instances and 10 variables/features which is classification data set

Project part-1:
1. Preprocessing of data i.e, for page block classification find missing values, replace them with average or mean of each column
2. Found the outliers in data and made a box plot to find outliers
3. Remove the outliers using the technique of interquartile range

Project part-2:
1. Check whether the data is imbalanced data or not 
2. Oversample or under sampling to be performed if required is imbalanced else this can be skipped
3. Split the data and perform normalization if required
4. Trained models using four models i.e, linear classifier , Decision trees, Random forest, Support Vector Machine non linear by model structure selection
5. Performed K-cross fold validation for all above model, plotted confusion matrix and classification report as model evaluation methods for classification

Project Part-3:
1. Performed Lasso regression to perform variable selection and trained using Random forest, Support Vector linear, Multi Layer Perceptron (ANN)
2. Performed Bidirectional variables selection to select features and train using Random forest, Support Vector linear, Multi Layer Perceptron (ANN)
3. Compared all the models
